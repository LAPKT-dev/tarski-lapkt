# Development Notes

## Requirements and Dependencies

Development of Tarski currently happens under Python 3.

## Code Style

We aim at following the [PEP 8 Python Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
Many Python IDEs support on-the-fly PEP 8 style checks, and there are also external tools
to help the code comply with the style guidelines, such as [Google's YAPF](https://github.com/google/yapf).
We might consider using one of these down the road.
